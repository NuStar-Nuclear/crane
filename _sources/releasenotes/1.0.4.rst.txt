#. b8865d8: can not allocate cell if the point is just on the cell side
#. cd3dea6: use flat radial transverse leakage for debug purpose
#. cd9866e: use incorrect formula to update radial net current for ucmfd solver
#. ba5d39b: leakage split term should be added to sigma tr in kernel add_source_to_scalar_flux for moc1d solver
#. 0000fee: leakage split term should be added to sigma tr in kernel add_source_to_scalar_flux for moc2d solver
#. 5d910de: if fission source is zero, do not divide it
#. 2243480: miss brackets in macros
#. 24b1b29: average radial leakage should be divide by cell area
#. db9702a: moc1d's cell avg flux should be comes from moc2d for each power iteration
#. 974fde1: the denominator of leakage split term should be angular flux, not scalar flux
#. bd84aca: volume-average axial transverse source should be divide by plane thickness, not mesh thickness
#. d774765: radial transverse source is a volume-averaged one before add to total mesh source
#. c35378a: radial leakage should be an integral value
#. 25e37a4: bad symbol used in transverse_sources calculation
#. a17a35a: incorrect memcpy size
